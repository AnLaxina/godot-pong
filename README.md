## How to Install/Play

### Windows:

Two options:

1. Download `Godot Pong.exe` in from the `Releases` tab
2. Clone the repo & open the `project.godot` file in the `Game` folder

### Mac/Linux/Android:

Unfortunately, I do not own any of these devices so please export the game yourselves with these general steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. In Godot, import the `project.godot` file located in the `Game` folder. 
3. If you have already installed Export Templates from the Template Manager or if you have the Steam version skip to step 4. Otherwise follow the instructions below:
   1. In the Godot Editor navigate to the top left of the screen and click on `Editor`
   2. Under `Editor` click on `Manage Export Templates...`
   3. A window called `Export Template Manager` should appear
   4. In the newly opened window, click on the `Download and Install` button.
   5. Wait for the download to finish and click `close`
4. In the Godot editor navigate to the top left of the screen and click on `Project -> Export...`
5. In the newly opened window click on `Add...` and choose the platform you would like to export to.
